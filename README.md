# RainRewind
A script that allows users to create animations to see how rain and wind measurements (from rain and wind gauges on the ground) evolve with time for a user-specified time period.

A sample animation ```anim.gif``` is included in the folder that shows the passing of a Sumatra Squall over Singapore on 17 September 2024.

# How to use
There is no user-interface as of now, so the only way to run this program is through the console/terminal. The main program to run is ```main.py``` located in the ```scripts/``` directory.

After successful running of the script, expect the animation for the time period you have specified in the ```gifs/``` directory. If you would like to look at the precipitation and wind data for further analysis, check them out in the ```DataFrames/``` directory.
