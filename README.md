# RainRewind
The Meteorological Service Singapore's website boasts a very useful feature that allows anybody to review rain radar images live (https://www.weather.gov.sg/weather-rain-area-50km/). However, there is no equivalent feature for rain gauge and wind sensor measurements which can be used to generate insightful visualisations of rainfall over Singapore. Here, I have written a program that allows users to create animations to see how rain and wind measurements (from rain and wind gauges on the ground) evolve with time for a user-specified time period.

# How to use
There is no user-interface as of now, so the only way to run this program is through the console/terminal. The main program to run is ```main.py``` located in the ```scripts/``` directory.

After successful running of the script, expect the animation for the time period you have specified in the ```gifs/``` directory. If you would like to look at the precipitation and wind data for further analysis, check them out in the ```DataFrames/``` directory.

# Some examples of usage
On the 17th of September 2024, Singapore was hit with an extraordinarily strong sumatra squall that swept across the island. It caused alot of damage throughout the island. Here is a gif that is generated by the program showing the propagation of the squall across the island that evening!
